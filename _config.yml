  # Frequently asked questions.
  faq:
    - question:      "What is a hackathon?"
      answer:        >
        A hackathon is an invention marathon. Students come together to build cool
        software & hardware hacks over 24-48 hours. It's [very beginner friendly](https://medium.com/@tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000#.cj21niskl).
    - question:      "How much does it cost?"
      answer:        >
        Nothing. Attending a hackathon is free.
    - question:      "Do I need to be a student to attend?"
      answer:        >
        No. Anyone over the age of 18 can attend.
    - question:      "I'm a complete beginner. Can I still come?"
      answer:        >
        Absolutely! We especially encourage people that are new in the field to come along as a hackathon is a great place to get started. [Drop us a message](mailto:cameron@ears-edi.com) if you have any concerns.
    - question:      "Where is the event?"
      answer:        >
        The event is being hosted at [Appleton Tower, The University of Edinburgh](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Appleton+Tower,+The+University+of+Edinburgh/@55.9443771,-3.1891978,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4887c78385c7685d:0x6f9d3da4d39209ee!8m2!3d55.9443771!4d-3.1870091?dcr=0).
    - question:      "What hardware will be available to use?"
      answer:        >
        You'll get access to a selection of standard components, microcontrollers and sensors.
        There will be a specific list of parts posted up here soon (watch this space!). If there is
        anything specific that you really want to use, you are welcome to bring it along!
    - question:      "How big are the teams?"
      answer:        >
        Teams are no bigger than 4 people.
    - question:      "Do you offer travel reimbursement?"
      answer:        >
        We cannot reimburse you for your travel expenses.
    - question:      "Is there a code of conduct?"
      answer:        >
        We will be using the MLH code of conduct and will be enforcing it very strongly. You can [find it here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf).
    - question:      "How does judging work?"
      answer:        >
        There will be 3 main winning teams that will be selected by a panel of judges.
        The judges will score hacks in a number of categories announced at the event.
        There will also be additional prizes for winners of specific challenges at the event. These challenges will
        involve meeting certain criteria specific to each one.
    - question:      "Do I have to use hardware in my hack?"
      answer:        >
        Yes, although don't be scared if you've never used hardware before! We'll have a team of elite mentors on site that will be helping you every step of the way. There will also be introductory workshops for beginners. Your hack will probably also include a software component.
